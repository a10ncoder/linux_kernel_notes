## Relationship between processes, Session, process group and thread group

Kernel use this information for  delivering signals to a collection of processes/threads.

When a process is created, it inherits group id of its parent. It can later change its group or create new 
group and becomes the group leader by calling setpgid. The group leader’s group id equals its pid.

`kill(pid_t pid, int sig)` with negative `pid` will send  signal to all members of group `-pid`. Similarly `waitpid` 
with negative `pid` wil wait for any member of group `-pid`.

Each group belong to a unique session. First process of a session (also group leader) is the session leader, 
its `pid` equals session id. The session can be changed by calling `setsid` but is usually called in login process.
Session has controlling tty (`/dev/tty`), signals generated by `CTRL-C/Z` are delivered to these processes of the 
foreground group of that session.

When a process is created, its ordinary thread id equals process id.  When additional thread is created with 
CLONE_THREAD it has different thread id  but same process id, which is called thread group id. The `gettid` returns 
thread id while getpid returns thread group id. `tkill` is used to send signal to a thread.
